# Car-Price-Predictor
A simple flask based application which uses the user's data of a car to predict the the estimated value using "Cat Boost Regressor"

• The Ai models are trained on the data of used car ads published on Pakwheels. Apart from "Cat Boost Regressor" two more models are prepared using "XGB Regressor" and "Random Forest Regressor". So based on the usage a user can shift to any model.

• Note: In the webpage two parameters are given "Condition and Repainted status", The model is not trained on these parameters, a seprate logic is applied for these two parameters.
